            <h2>About Mother Teresa</h2>
            <p>Early Life and Calling Mother Teresa was born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, now part of North Macedonia. From a young age, she was deeply moved by the stories of missionaries and their work, which inspired her to dedicate her life to serving others. At the age of 18, she left her home to join the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland, where she began her spiritual journey.

                Founding the Missionaries of Charity In 1950, Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata, India. The organization focused on serving the poorest of the poor, providing care to the sick, abandoned, and dying. Over time, her work expanded worldwide, establishing homes and centers in more than 130 countries.
                
                Unwavering Compassion Mother Teresa believed in showing love and kindness to those society often overlooked. She tended to leprosy patients, fed the hungry, and provided shelter to the homeless, treating every individual with dignity and respect. Her actions were driven by a simple philosophy: "Not all of us can do great things, but we can do small things with great love."
                
                Global Recognition and Legacy For her tireless humanitarian work, Mother Teresa received numerous accolades, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979. Despite her worldwide recognition, she remained humble, continuing to live a life of simplicity and service. She passed away on September 5, 1997, but her legacy lives on through the Missionaries of Charity and the countless lives she touched.
                
                Inspiration to the World Mother Teresa's life is a testament to the power of selfless love and compassion. Her unwavering faith, dedication to the underprivileged, and ability to inspire others to serve have made her a symbol of hope and humanity around the globe.</p>
